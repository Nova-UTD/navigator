Motion planner {#motion-planner}
===========

This is the design document for the `motion_planner` package.

# Purpose / Use cases
The motion Planner is used to determine immediate trajectory of the car.

It uses the ideal path generated by the behavior planner to create a set of candidate short-term trajectories (constructed by line segments). It selects the trajectory that minimizes a cost function.

The cost function is affection by factors such as: how hard the car is steering on the trajectory, will there be any collisions, and how far the car is from the ideal path.

The motion planner also determines the speed of the car, given maximum speeds along the ideal path from the behavior planner.
