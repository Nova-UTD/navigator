Our vehicle also has front and rear Velodyne Puck (VLP-16) LiDAR sensors. These generate rich, precise 3D scans of our surroundings using 16 channels of spinning lasers. Our platform uses ZED stereo cameras to gather color images and their corresponding depth information. Stereo cams can give us limited 3D information, but they are best used in conjuction with more accurate LiDAR data. We currently use an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier for our onboard computing. This is likely to change soon, as we have exceeded the power capabilities of this device. Finally, an Adafruit Metro Grand Central serves as our real-time microcontroller. This device handles time-critical services, such as releasing our steering wheel if our high-level software fails. ",

The process for assigning velocities works as follows: . | For each point, set its speed to the speed limit of the lane | For each point, calculate the local curvature of the path. Using the path curvature, limit the speed for that point so that the lateral acceleration of the vehicle is never more than a configured maximum | For each zone, determine if it intersects with the trajectory. If it does: . | The trajectory is a discrete path, so the first point affected may be further from the edge of the zone than we would like. To observe the speed limitation starting from the very edge of the zone, insert a new point to the trajectory where it intersects the zone (both entering and exiting) | Set the speed of this new point to the lowest speed among its adjacent points the zone | For all points within the zone, set the speed to no greater than the zone speed | . | Do a backwards pass of the trajectory, and lower the speed of each point so that the speed of the next point (next in time, previous point in the pass) can be achieved with comfortable deceleration. The only time this may not be physically obtainable is immediately in front of the vehicle when it is moving too fast: in this case, lower the speed anyway and let the controller sort it out | Do a forwards pass of the trajectory, and lower the speed of each point so it can be reached from the previous point using a comfortable acceleration | . Although the path itself may extend from the origin to the destination, only the points within a certain horizon of the vehicle need to be considered for the trajectory. Notice that aside from step 1, the speed is never increased. The vehicle should be cautious, meaning that if there is a reason to go slow and a reason to go regular speed, the reason to go slow wins as a rule of thumb. Since this is true, as long as acceleration/deceleration smoothing is done last, the other steps can be done in any order. void MotionPlannerNode::send_message() { if (ideal_path == nullptr || odometry == nullptr) { // RCLCPP_WARN(this-&gt;get_logger(), \"motion planner has no input path, skipping...\"); return; } Trajectory tmp = build_trajectory(ideal_path, horizon); if(zones != nullptr){ limit_to_zones(tmp, *zones); } limit_to_curvature(tmp, max_lat_accel); smooth(tmp, max_accel, max_decel); trajectory_publisher-&gt;publish(tmp); return; } .

It will actually typically create two zones: one zone with a speed of 0 signifying not to move through the space at all, and one larger zone with a lower speed indicating where the vehicle may pass but should be cautious. One limitation of the zone architecture is that obstacle zones need to be larger than the actual obstacles. This is because speeds are assigned as intersections with the trajectory, which has zero width. The car does not have zero width, and so can physically go through zones that the path did not intersect. At this time, the primary function of the BehaviorPlanner node is traffic control. Using a state machine, it will create zones around intersections, and then remove them when it is safe to proceed. ## Strengths and Weaknesses . Strengths: . | Zones are an easily understood description of what the car is doing | Zones can accomplish any sort of stop-go behavior we need, including following another vehicle | .

The perception system identifies this red blob as a stop sign and generates a bounding box with the coordinates of the stop sign relative to the car. The planning system determines that we must set our speed to zero at the stop sign. The controls system notes that our car is still moving, and calculates that we must decelerate a certain amount.
