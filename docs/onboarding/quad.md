# SSH Information

We encourage you to code from the Quad (our beefy server in the upstairs lab). This will give you experience working in the Ubuntu/Linux OS environment. Also, it's already equipped with Docker. How can I connect remotely? Use SSH!

- We use [NoMachine](https://www.nomachine.com/) for remote desktop.  
- If off-campus, be sure to connect via the [UTD GlobalProtect VPN](https://atlas.utdallas.edu/TDClient/30/Portal/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=167) to enable SSH.

[Here's a video tutorial](ssh_tutorial.mp4) that demonstrates GlobalProtect VPN, SSH, NoMachine, and VS Code SSH.

Also, feel free to set up an SSH key for easier log-in access.
