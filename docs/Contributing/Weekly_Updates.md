Before each Team Meeting, please update your Github task(s) with a new comment including the following information in this format. Also make sure the task's tags are updated (e.g, "In-Progress" "Help-Needed", etc).

- **Status:**
- **Next Steps:**
- **Projected Completion:**
- **Update:**

For example:

- **Status:** Doing literature search on best methods for localization.
- **Next Steps:** Select one and implement it.
- **Projected Completion:** Monday Sept 16
- **Update:** <insert paragraph with details about what you've done this past week>

Come to the meeting ready to give a brief update to the group on your task. This is also our easist opportunity to coordinate on "handoff" items where two tasks may meet over a shared ROS topic or some dependency, so raise any issues or questions that others might need to weigh in on.
