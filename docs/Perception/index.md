## The perception subsystem of Navigator takes the data from various sensors and extracts meaningful information for downstream components.

Some of the tasks that are core parts of perception include, but are not limited to:
- LiDAR/Camera/Radar/GNSS processing and transformaation
- Obstacle and scene classifiation
- Obstacle tracking
- Occupancy grid production

Each section here is an individual node within our perception component. Many of the packages/nodes within perception are "in-progress". As Navigator progresses, we will update, add, or remove documentation.
