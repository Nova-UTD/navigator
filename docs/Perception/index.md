# Perception overview

*Maintained by Nova*

The perception component of the system takes the data from various sensors and extracts meaningful information for downstream components such as planning.

Some of the tasks that are core parts of the perception include, but not limited to:
- Localization and state estimation
- Obstacle and scene classifiation
- Obstacle tracking and prediction

In this page we will go each individual packages that is part of the perception component. A lot of the packages within perception are "in-progress" just as with most other packages within our system. As this project progresses, we will update the existing packages as well as add new ones to meet the growing demands of our autonomous system.
