## The planning subsystem takes real-time *perception* and *mapping* data and determines what our vehicle should do. 

Our planning architecture relies on a unique layering of [cost maps](../system-overview.md#cost-maps) to traverse a representation of our environment and produce a "cost-effective" trajectory which ultimately translates to real-world actuation.
