## This branch aims to solve SLAM and map-based-localization.

### src/localization/lidar_localization
- Ros2 package that uses ```combined_map.pcd``` located in ```resource/```. To replace this, combined_map.pcd must be replaced with another pointcloud file of the same name and extension. I'm honestly not sure if running ```colcon build``` is needed to update it all, but you might as well run that in the ```/navigator/``` directory.
- The node is automatically run when ```launch launches/launch.carla.py``` is executed, but it can also be run by executing ```run lidar_localization localization_node```
- Rviz should be set up on this branch to show the gnss_gt vector alongside the vector returned by the localization node, but if not:
  - Navigate to the view tab under panes, then set the frame to base_link.
  - In the left toolbar, set the fixed frame to the map frame.
  - In the left toolbar, click add, then under topics add the odometry topics under gnss_gt and lidar_localization.
    
### src/mapping/lidar_slam_testing
- This folder contains offline python scripts that allow for the testing and viewing of trajectories generated by kiss-slam, as well as by the same localization pipeline that runs in the ros node mentioned above

### src/mapping/kiss_slam_mapping
- Ros2 package that uses ```kiss-slam``` to generate maps. TODO WILL FINISH
