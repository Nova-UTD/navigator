  ros__parameters:
    device_ip: "192.168.1.201" # The IP address that the Velodyne is on. From the factory, this is 192.168.1.201.
    gps_time: false # Whether to use data capture time from a GPS, or from the local time. Should only be set to True if a GPS is attached to the Velodyne. False by default.
    time_offset: 0.0 # An arbitrary "skew", in seconds, to add to the acquisition timestamp. Defaults to 0.0.
    enabled: true # Whether the device should start-up enabled or not. Defaults to True.
    frame_id: "lidar_left" # The frame_id to use when constructing the header for the packet to be published. Defaults to "velodyne".
    model: "VLP16" #  The model number of the Velodyne attached. This should be one of 64E, 64E_S2, 64E_S2.1, 64E_S3, 32E, 32C, or VLP16. Defaults to 64E.
    rpm: 600.0 # The RPM that the Velodyne is configured for. Note that this is descriptive, not prescriptive, so this should be set to match the value configured through the Velodyne web interface.
    cut_angle: 6.283185307179586 # The azimuth angle at which to declare a single rotation complete. If this is less than 0, then a fixed number of packets (device-dependent) is used per rotation. This mostly works, but can vary because of variations in the hardware. If a positive number <= 2Pi, a rotation will be declared "complete" when the azimuth reported by the device reaches that value. Defaults to 2Pi.
    port: 2368
